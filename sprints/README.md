## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development
### Code Development
- Start with clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- Break down complex features into smaller, testable units
- Use AI to generate boilerplate and basic implementations
- Always review and test AI-generated code

### Code Review Prompts
- "Review this code for security vulnerabilities and best practices"
- "Suggest optimizations for this implementation"
- "Help me write tests for this function"
- "Validate this API design against REST principles"

### Testing Prompts
- "Generate unit tests for this Rust function"
- "Create integration tests for this API endpoint"
- "Write React component tests using Jest"
